Why is there a 100 MB partition on my Windows system? Don't know, I deleted it. It wasn't a good idea. This is a short note how I rescued my system.

mark the partition where windows 7 is installed as active:

Go in the repair mode and answer ok ;-)

Don't know how it worked particularly, it was just a note I found and thougt I could share it ;-)
