Donâ€™t do a <code>sudo yum install node</code> if you want to install node.js.
There is currently (fedora 16) no node.js package.

i got a strange error <code>cant find /etc/ax25/axports</code> when trying to run a rails application.

To use node.js go clone the <a href="https://github.com/joyent/node">git repository at github.com</a> and build it yourself.
