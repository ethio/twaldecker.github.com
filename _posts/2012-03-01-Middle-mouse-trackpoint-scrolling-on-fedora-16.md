Just figured out how a long missed feature can be configured on fedora16: the scrolling with the middle mouse button and the trackpoint.

I liked this very much and couldn't figure it out how to do it.

Here is a short note:

    thomas@thinky ~ % sudo yum install gpointing-device-settings

And configure following in the GUI.
