I had to install Windows 7 Home Premium on a Laptop where the DVD drive doesn't work. I ordered DVDs, and realized it doesn't boot.

After creating a .iso image of the DVD I realized the [Windows USB tool](http://emea.microsoftstore.com/DE/de-DE/Service-Center/Windows-7-USB-DVD-Download-Tool) isn't accepting custom .iso images, just the ordered from the windows shop.

To make the Windows tool accepting your .iso file you can use the tool from withinwindows:

After using it the Windows USB tool is accepting my image.
