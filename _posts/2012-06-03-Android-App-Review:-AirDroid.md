AirDroid is a Android app which provides a webinterface to your Android device. The webinterface is accessed through the local WiFi. The most useful feature for me is to write Textmessages (SMS) from your Laptop. The interface is very well designed and the app is for free.

Screenshot of the Webinterface:
